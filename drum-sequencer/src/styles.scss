  GLOBAL STYLES METHODOLOGY: Here we follow the ITCSS method, popularized by Harry Roberts. It involves layering the global stylesheet into
  and "inverted triangle", with more generic, far-reaching styles at the top, and more explicit, narrowly focused styles toward the bottom.

/*
  I'm admittedly still adapting to Sass's new module system, so I may adapt the way I import partials/layers in the future. For now, I'm
  assuming that any partials that need settings or tools will import them as namespaces from those layers.
